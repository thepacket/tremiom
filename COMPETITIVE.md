# Tremiom — Competitive Analysis vs. 17 Reference Tools

Scope: feature gaps and differentiators for Tremiom v0.1.3 (web-based real-time + historical seismic viewer) measured against the popular seismology software ecosystem. Engineering tone, no marketing.

## 3. Gap list — prioritized

Ordered by impact for a seismology audience. "Effort" assumes Tremiom's existing stack (Python worker, ObsPy, scipy, WS multiplexer, Vite/TS frontend, DrumHistory buckets).

1. **3-component (Z/N/E) scope and spectrogram** — Single-channel-only is the biggest analyst-credibility gap. Competitors: Swarm, SeisComP, SeisGram2K, Snuffler, ObsPy, PQLX, RS DataView, Antelope, Earthworm. **Effort: Medium.** Subscribe to BH1/BH2 or BHN/BHE alongside BHZ in the worker; extend panel layouts to optionally stack 3 traces; reuse existing filter+STA/LTA paths.

2. **Particle motion / hodogram panel** — Standard tool for visualizing P/S/Rayleigh polarization; trivial once 3-C is wired. Competitors: Swarm, SeisGram2K, Snuffler, ObsPy. **Effort: Easy** (after 3-C).

3. **Instrument response removal + Wood-Anderson / displacement / velocity / acceleration toggle** — Required for any quantitative work; today's drum/scope show raw counts. Competitors: SeisComP, Antelope, Earthworm, SeisGram2K, Snuffler, ObsPy, PQLX. **Effort: Medium.** ObsPy `attach_response` + `remove_response`, cache StationXML per station; expose as a topbar select alongside the bandpass dropdown.

4. **PPSD (probabilistic PSD)** — The single most-asked-for noise/QC plot. Competitors: SeisComP (scqcv), PQLX, ObsPy, Snuffler, Antelope. **Effort: Easy.** ObsPy `PPSD` class consumes the existing trace stream; render as heatmap with NLNM/NHNM overlays.

5. **Manual phase picker with persisted markers** — Step from "viewer" to "tool." Competitors: SeisComP, Antelope, SeisGram2K, Snuffler, Earthworm, ObsPy. **Effort: Medium.** Click-to-place P/S markers on scope/drum/record-section, store in a session-scoped catalog (server-side SQLite), export as QuakeML or CSV.

6. **Multi-station live overlay / mini-network drum** — GeoNet drums + Swarm wave clipboard semantics in one panel. Competitors: Swarm, SeisComP, GeoNet, Earthworm, Antelope, Snuffler. **Effort: Medium.** Reuse DrumHistory + subscription multiplexing; add a "Group" UI on top of the curated GSN list.

7. **Recording / replay / export of arbitrary windows** — Click-drag on the drum → download MiniSEED / PNG / WAV. Competitors: everyone except the read-only galleries. **Effort: Easy.** Wire FDSN dataselect on demand; reuse existing FDSN backfill code.

8. **RSAM panel (10 s / 1 min / 10 min bins)** — Volcanologist-favourite continuous-amplitude tracker. Competitors: Swarm, Earthworm, Antelope, ObsPy. **Effort: Easy.** Already have envelope buckets in DrumHistory — just resample and plot.

9. **Station QC dashboard (gaps, latency, clock drift, daily RMS)** — Operator-grade visibility; differentiator for network owners. Competitors: SeisComP scqcv, PQLX, Antelope, Earthworm. **Effort: Medium.** Per-station heartbeat already exists in worker; surface gap/latency/RMS metrics.

10. **Event locator** — Even a single-event TauP-based grid-search using selected picks. Competitors: SeisComP, Antelope, Earthworm, Snuffler, ObsPy. **Effort: Hard.** Needs picker (#5) first, plus velocity model handling.

11. **Felt-reports overlay on event detail** — Trivial USGS DYFI / EMSC felt-report integration. Competitors: GeoNet, EMSC LastQuake, GEOFON. **Effort: Easy.** USGS DYFI API exists; render polygons on the world map.

12. **Focal mechanism beachballs on event markers** — Pull from USGS/GEOFON MT feeds. Competitors: GEOFON, GeoNet, SeisComP, Antelope. **Effort: Easy** (rendering only — USGS event JSON includes MT when available; ObsPy has `beachball`).

13. **Mobile-responsive layout** — Currently desktop only. Competitors: GeoNet, EMSC, RS StationView, GEOFON. **Effort: Medium.** CSS/layout work; collapse 4-panel grid to single-panel carousel below ~600 px.

14. **Wave clipboard / multi-trace workbench** — Pin traces from different stations/times to a scratch panel for comparison. Competitors: Swarm, Antelope, Snuffler, ObsPy, PyWEED. **Effort: Medium.**

15. **Alerts / named triggers (push or email)** — STA/LTA already runs server-side; expose persisted threshold rules. Competitors: SeisComP, Earthworm, Antelope, EMSC. **Effort: Medium** (mostly auth+notification plumbing, not DSP).

16. **PyWEED-style bulk event-station downloader** — One-shot record-section export for a region/time. Competitors: PyWEED, Wilber 3. **Effort: Easy** (mostly UI on top of existing FDSN code).

17. **Magnitude estimation per pick set** — Once response removal + picker land, ML/Mb/Mw is small. Competitors: SeisComP, Antelope, Earthworm, ObsPy. **Effort: Medium.**

---

## 4. Things Tremiom already does that almost no one else does well

- **Synchronized drum + spectrogram + STA/LTA + PSD + world map + event sidebar in one screen, all live**. Swarm gets close on desktop but never in a browser; RS DataView only does single-panel-at-a-time.
- **Server-side Butterworth (sosfiltfilt) applied uniformly across all time-domain panels and the spectrogram** from a single dropdown. Most tools force per-panel filter configuration; Tremiom guarantees panel consistency by construction.
- **Event arrival markers projected onto the drum at the predicted P time** (magnitude-colored dot + tick). Snuffler and SeisComP show markers, but tying them to the 24-h drum row position is unusual.
- **24-h FDSN backfill on subscribe** — drum is "full" the instant a user lands. Most live viewers start empty and fill over hours.
- **Browser-only, single-token deploy** (~220 MB Docker image, one-click fly.io). All true-comparable real-time tools are Java desktop apps; the only browser competitors (RS DataView, GeoNet drums) lack analysis depth.
- **One Python worker hosting SeedLink + ring buffers + DrumHistory + FDSN backfill** — simpler ops than Earthworm's module-soup or SeisComP's full pipeline.
- **TauP overlays on a per-event record section, fetched on demand from FDSN with curated 6-nearest selection** — Wilber 3 + Global Seismogram Viewer can produce something similar but require manual station selection and a request workflow.
- **Curated GSN broadband list combined with full-IRIS station search + AM/Shake** in the same picker. Nobody else mixes the curated/explore model this cleanly.

## 5. Recommended next 5–10 features

In order of recommended build sequence; each chosen for ratio of (impact to seismology audience) ÷ (effort given current stack).

1. **3-component (Z/N/E) subscription + panel layout** — Unblocks particle motion, polarization, rotation, 3-C spectrograms, hodograms. Single biggest credibility step.
2. **Instrument response removal + units toggle (counts / velocity / displacement / Wood-Anderson)** — Moves Tremiom from "pretty viewer" to "analysis tool." ObsPy already in the stack; mostly StationXML caching and a topbar select.
3. **PPSD panel with NLNM/NHNM overlays** — Highest-value QC view; pure ObsPy; visible payoff for station operators.
4. **Particle motion panel** — Cheap once #1 lands; instant visual win for teaching/marketing.
5. **RSAM panel** — Reuses DrumHistory envelopes; brings in the volcano-monitoring audience that Swarm owns.
6. **Click-drag-to-export on the drum (MiniSEED + PNG)** — Lowest-effort, highest-frequency feature request a real user will have within minutes.
7. **Manual phase picker with QuakeML export** — Foundation for future locator/magnitude work; differentiates from every browser tool.
8. **Felt-reports + focal-mechanism overlay on the world map** — Free data from USGS/GEOFON; closes the citizen-science gap vs. LastQuake/GeoNet/GEOFON with one API integration.
9. **Multi-station live overlay (a "Drum group")** — Matches GeoNet's strongest UX while keeping Tremiom's per-row analysis depth.
10. **Mobile-responsive layout** — Last because the analyst use case is desktop, but the citizen-science audience expects it; one good CSS pass.
